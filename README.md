Subtitles for the Optimizing for Happiness talk
===============================================

The "Optimizing for Happiness" talk was given by Tom Preston Werner at the [StarTechConf 2011][startechconf] in Santiago, Chile. This is an attempt to translate its contents to Spanish and make easier further translations by maintaining an English-written transcript of them.

The video of the talk has been published by the conference organizers and can be found [on their website][source].

Usage
-----

### From a desktop video player

Each `.srt` file name ends with a language code (example: `es` for Spanish) and contains the subtitles for that language.
Most video players should be able to load them as external subtitles file. [VLC][vlc] can do that, is free, and is available for most platforms.

On Ubuntu, open the video with Totem, then `View > Subtitles > Select Text Subtitle...`

### Using the Vimeo player

It may be possible to use an external file for subtitles, I don't know.

Corrections and contributions
-----------------------------

Both Spanish and English files are perfectible. Translations may be improved, transcriptions and timmings certainly should. It's a time consuming activity and contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue and submit a pull request.

The XML project file was created using [Subtitle Editor][editor] which can generate and handle a waveform, and provides (in my opinion) useful shortcuts to make the subtitles placement less painful.

License
-------

I don't know which licenses apply to talks that are given at conferences. The contents of the talk obviously belong to Tom Preston Werner.

Ideas sometimes can't be written down in the terms they were spoken. However, in spite of some few adjustments, the intention of this work is to be faithful to the original content (and not to be considered as a derived product nor a modification). Given that, in order to make it useful and *if applicable*, the result of my own work is licensed under the Modified BSD license.
